# Pathfinders

A visual representation of Pathfinding Algorithms. They are fascinating to look at, hope they're equally interesting to build out.

## Motivation
Loved what [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu) did in his project on Pathfinding Algorithms. Thought I'd give it a shot and learn as much as I can.

## How to use?
Even I have no idea at this point on how to use this. Perhaps I'll figure it out in the due course of time.

## Contribute
Feel free to help out!

## Credits
Started as a fork of [Pathfinding-Visualizer](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer). Wanted to include as many algorithms as possible while keeping the code as simple as possible

### License
Don't have one. Should I get one? If yes, do let me know on how to get one!
